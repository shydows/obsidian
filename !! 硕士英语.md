总纲：大家每天都在用互联网，这里介绍一些网络的基础概念，和一些需要注意的关键信息
Good morning, everyone.
As is known to all, almost everyone in the world use the Internet. 
So today we are gonna introduce some basic and critical concepts , and also some interesting and noteworthy facts of the network to you.
Hope you guys will like it, and think it's useful.
Ok, let's begin our today's presentation.
第一部分
...
第二部分
...
第三部分
OK, let's get into the third part.

slide1 演唱会抢票网页 引出DDos
I believe that everyone here should be very familiar with this ticket grabbing interface.
In our daily lives, we encounter many such scenarios, such as booking tickets for tourist attractions and grabbing tickets for concerts.
But at the same time, we often find that the website is not responding, especially in the first few minutes of the ticket purchase.
Because a large number of people enter the website almost at the same time, fearing that they will not be able to grab the tickets successfully.
So why did the website crash? And what happened behind it?

slide2 什么是DDoS 图片展示
To explain these questions, we are gonna to introduce a concept named DDos to you.
Step further, What is DDos?  And what are its principles and features?
For these questions, we are gonna answer later.

slide3 ddos分几个特点 少文字 另一半dos（与之对应的，还有一个概念叫做dos）
DDoS, Distributed Denial of Service.
Let's put 「distributed」 aside for now.
We first explain the concept named Dos, Denial of Service.
As the names suggest, they all refuse to respond to users' requests, But why?
In fact, the reason is really simple：
Because for the severs, there are too many requests in a short period of time to handle.
They can't fix it, so they just give up(放一个摆烂的图片)
As for the difference, it's also not difficult to understand.
In DDOS, these repeated requests come from a large number of different devices, while in DOS, the source is relatively single.
In fact, this is also the meaning of 「distributed」we put aside before.

slide4 一个疯狂点击鼠标的图，配文“你在抢票的时候很可能参与了一次对目标网站的ddos攻击”
So the interesting fact is that when you grabbing the ticket, you may have participated in a DDOS attack on the target website.

slide5  一张百度搜索的图片，包含网址https
OK, let's move on.
I believe that everyone uses search engines countless times everyday.
But have you ever noticed that some URL start with http while the others start with https? So if you have noticed it, have you ever wondered what's the difference？

slide6 类似3的对比，最后来一个大的“secure”落下来到https一边
OK, Simply put, https is more secure than http.
「Secure」is represented by the last「s」in 「https」, which also means that the communication security is guaranteed by SSL or TLS .
SSL represents Secure Sockets Layer, TLS represents Transport Layer Security,
and both of them are encryption technology.

slide7
OK, let's keep going.
在我们使用互联网时，我们可能会希望网页能记住我们的一些偏好设置，甚至是身份信息，
使我们不需要每次访问都需要重新登陆或者设置，大大改善用户体验。
When we use the Internet, we may hope that the website can remember some of our preferences, or even identity information, so that we do not need to log in or set up every time we visit, and it can greatly improves the user experience.
但不论是HTTP还是HTTPS ，他们都不会保留之前的交互记录，每次请求和响应都是独立的。
事实上，要想「记住每一个用户」，我们需要用到一个名为「Cookies」的技术
But whether it is HTTP or HTTPS, they will not keep the previous interaction records, and each request and response is independent.
In fact, in order to "remember every user", we need to use a technology called "Cookies".
Cookies 是存储在用户浏览器上的小数据文件，服务器可以通过 HTTP 响应将数据存储到浏览器中，浏览器随后在每次向服务器发起请求时会自动携带这些数据。从而达到“记住用户”的目的。
Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the user's browser. The server can send a cookie via an HTTP response, and the browser will automatically store it and send it back to the server with each subsequent request to achieve the purpose of "remembering the user".

slide Quesiton
OK, in the end of the third part, there is also a simple question for you.
you can scan the QR code, and answer the question on your phone.

`Q: Which is more secure, HTTPs or HTTP?`
`A.http B.https c.same d.depend on the situation`

have u ever finished?
OK, let's take a look at the distribution of our classmates' choices.
...

slide9 
图：现在请开始写一个自己的网站吧（恶搞）
“鉴于有很多同学都答对了我们设计的课堂问题，相信大家已经很好的掌握了网络相关的基础知识，那么请大家运用今天学到的知识，在课后开始搭建一个属于自己的小网站吧！
我们今天的展示就到此结束了，谢谢大家”
We can see that most of you have answered the questions correctly, 
and I believe that everyone has mastered the basic knowledge of the Internet. 
So you can try to build your own website now! using the knowledge you have learned today.
OK, this is all of our presentation. Thanks for your listening.

```
(slide) 
两个图，XSS，CRSF
“关于网络安全的问题，比较常见的还有XSS，CRSF（一句话概括原理）”
（slide）
CDN的图，分布式网络的图
“为了让我们的网络访问又安全又快速，我们可以使用CDN；
我们在Ddos和dos的关键区别中提到了一个分布式网络，我们总说技术无罪，关键看人们怎么使用，事实上，CDN就是基于分布式网络，（基于时长看要不要讲原理）”
```
